#### INTRODUCTION TO DATA STURCTURES AND ALGORITHIMS##
*data sturcture is inside the main memory
*when you are pulling data from the storage to the main memory you need datastructures
* data can  (big data)  be categorised into, two legacydata and operational data

### STATIC VS DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION
*memory is divided into smaller addressable units called bytes
*the entire memory is not used a single memory but is divided into units called a SEGMENT
which is usually 64kb 

###HOW A PROGRAM USES MAIN MEMORY###
*The program uses the memory by dividing it into three section called the stack,heap and the code segment.
*When a program is run it is palced first on the code section.once it is loded the cpu will start executing the program.
*where the variable are loaded which are defined inside a program or a function is  called the stack frame and activation record.
*Static memory allocation refers to a method of allocating memory for variables at compile time.

##HEAP##
*heap is unorganized
*heap memory should be treated as a resource
*program cannot access heap memory directly
*programs access memory with the use of a pointer
